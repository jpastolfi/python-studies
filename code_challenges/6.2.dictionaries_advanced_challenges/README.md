1. Word Length Dict
Let’s start by writing a function that creates a new dictionary based on a list of strings. The keys of our dictionary will be every string in our list of strings, while the values will be the length of each of the words in the string list.

2. Frequency Count
This next function is similar, but instead of counting the length of each string in the list of strings, we will be counting the frequency of each string. This function will also accept a list of strings as input and return a new dictionary. 

3. Unique Values
Now let’s try reading a dictionary as input and finding how many values are unique. The function should return a number which is the count of all values from the dictionary without including duplicates.

4. Count First Letter
This function accepts a dictionary where the keys are last names and the values are lists of first names of people who have that last name. We need to calculate the number of people who have the same first letter in their last name.
