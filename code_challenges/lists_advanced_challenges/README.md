1. Every Three Numbers
Let’s start our challenging problems with a function that creates a list of numbers up to 100 in increments of 3 starting from a number that is passed to the function as an input parameter.

2. Remove Middle
Our next function will remove all elements from a list with an index within a certain range. The function will accept a list, a starting index, and an ending index. All elements with an index between the starting and ending index should be removed from the list. 

3. More Frequent Item
Let’s go back to our factory example. We have a conveyor belt of items where each item is represented by a different number. We want to know, out of two items, which one shows up more on our belt. To solve this, we can use a function with three parameters. One parameter for the list of items, another for the first item we are comparing, and another for the second item.

Our next function will double a value at a given position. We will provide a list and an index to double. This will create a new list by replacing the value at the index provided with double the original value. If the index is invalid then we should return the original list.

4. Double Index
Our next function will double a value at a given position. We will provide a list and an index to double. This will create a new list by replacing the value at the index provided with double the original value. If the index is invalid then we should return the original list.

5. Middle Item
For the final code challenge, we are going to create a function that finds the middle item from a list of values. This will be different depending on whether there are an odd or even number of values. In the case of an odd number of elements, we want this function to return the exact middle value. If there is an even number of elements, it returns the average of the middle two elements.
