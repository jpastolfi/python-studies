1. Sum Values
For the first code challenge, we are going to look at only the values in a dictionary. This function should sum up all of the values from the key-value pairs in the dictionary. 

2. Even Keys
Next, we are going to do something similar, but we are going to use the keys in order to retrieve the values. Additionally, we are going to only look at every even key within the dictionary.

3. Add Ten
Let’s loop through the keys again, but this time let’s modify the values within the dictionary. Our function should add 10 to every value in the dictionary and return the modified dictionary. 

4. Values That Are Keys
We are making a program that will create a family tree. Using a dictionary, we want to return a list of all the children who are also parents of other children. Using dictionaries we can consider those people to be values which are also keys in our dictionary of family data. 

5. Largest Value
For the last challenge, we are going to create a function that is able to find the maximum value in the dictionary and return the associated key. This is a twist on the max algorithm since it is using a dictionary rather than a list.
