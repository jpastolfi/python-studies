1. Tenth Power
Let’s create some functions which can help us solve math problems! For this first function, we are going to take the tenth power of a number.

2. Square Root
Another useful function for solving math problems is the square root function. We can create this using similar steps from the last problem. The code will look very similar. 

3. Win Percentage
Next, we will create a function which calculates the percentage of games won. In order to do this, we will need to know how many total games there were and divide the number of wins by the total number of games. For this function, there will be two input parameters, the number of wins and the number of losses. We also need to make sure that we return the result as a percentage (in the range of 0 to 100). 

4. Average
Let’s create a function which takes the average of two numbers. These two numbers will be the input of the function and the output will be the average of the two. 

5. Remainder
For the final challenge in this group, we are going to take the remainder of two numbers while performing other mathematical operations on them. We are going to multiply the numerator by 2 and divide the denominator by 2. After the two values have been modified, we will divide them and return the remainder.
