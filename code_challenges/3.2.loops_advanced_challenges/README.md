1. Larger Sum
We are going to start our advanced challenge problems by calculating which list of two inputs has the larger sum. We will iterate through each of the list and calculate the sums, afterwards we will compare the two and return which one has a greater sum.

2. Over 9000
We are constructing a device that is able to measure the power level of our coding abilities and according to the device, it will be impossible for our power levels to be over 9000. Because of this, as we iterate through a list of power values we will count up each of the numbers until our sum reaches a value greater than 9000. Once this happens, we should stop adding the numbers and return the value where we stopped.

3. Max Num
Here is a more traditional coding problem for you. This function will be used to find the maximum number in a list of numbers. This can be accomplished using the max() function in python, but as a challenge, we are going to manually implement this function.

4. Same Values
In this challenge, we need to find the indices in two equally sized lists where the numbers match. We will be iterating through both of them at the same time and comparing the values, if the numbers are equal, then we record the index.

5. Reversed List
For the final challenge, we are going to test two lists to see if the second list is the reverse of the first list. There are a few different ways to approach this, but we are going to try a method that iterates through each of the values in one direction for the first list and compares them against the values starting from the other direction in the second list.
