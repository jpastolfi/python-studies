1. First Three Multiples
Let’s start by creating a function which both prints and returns values. For this function, we are going to print out the first three multiples of a number and return the third multiple. This means that we are going to print 1, 2, and 3 times the input number and then return the value of 3 times the input number.

2. Tip
Let’s say we are going to a restaurant and we decide to leave a tip. We can create a function to easily calculate the amount to tip based on the total cost of the food and a percentage. This function will accept both of those values as inputs and return the amount of money to tip.

3. Bond, James Bond
It’s time to re-create a famous movie scene through code. Our function is going to concatenate strings together in order to replace James Bond’s name with whatever name we want. The input to our function will be two strings, one for a first name and another for a last name. The function will return a string consisting of the famous phrase but replaced with our inputs. 

4. Dog Years
Let’s create a function which calculates a dog’s age in dog years! This function will accept the name of the dog and the age in human years. It will calculate the age of the dog in dog years and return a string describing the dog’s age. 

5. All Operations
For the final code challenge, we are going to perform multiple mathematical operations on multiple inputs to the function. We will begin with adding the first two inputs, then we will subtract the third and fourth inputs. After that, we will multiply the first result and the second result. In the end, we will return the remainder of the previous result divided by the first input. We will also print each of the steps.
