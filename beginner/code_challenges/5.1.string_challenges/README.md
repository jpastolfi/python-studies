1. Count Letters
For the first code challenge, we are going to count the number of unique letters in a string. This means that when we are looking at the word, any new letters should be counted and any duplicates should not be counted. There are a few ways to solve this, but we can use the provided alphabet string to ensure that duplicates are not counted. 

2. Count X
Next, we are going to try something a bit different. This time we are going to count the number of occurrences of a certain letter within a string. Our function will accept a parameter for a string and another for the character which we are going to count. For example, providing the word "mississippi" and the character 's' would result in an answer of 4. 

3. Count Multi X
Now let’s change our function to compare against an entire string instead of a single character. This function should accept a string and a substring to compare against. The number of occurrences of the second parameter within the first parameter string are returned. What this means is that we are checking the number of occurrences of the shorter string (second parameter) within the longer string (first parameter). One way to accomplish this is using the split function. 

4. Substring Between
Here is a challenging problem. We need a function that is able to extract a portion of a string between two characters. The function will take three parameters where the first parameter is the string we are going to extract the substring from, the second input is the starting character of our substring and the third character is the ending character of our substring.

5. X Length
Let’s use the split method in a different way. We need a new function that is able to accept two inputs: one for a sentence and another for a number. The function returns True if every single word in the sentence has a length greater than or equal to the number provided.
