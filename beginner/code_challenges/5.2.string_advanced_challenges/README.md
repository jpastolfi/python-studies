1. Check Name
You are creating an app that allows users to interact and share their coding project ideas online. The first step is to provide your name in the application and a greeting for other people to see which contains your name. Let’s create a function that is able to check if a user’s name is located within their greeting. We need a function that accepts two parameters, a string for our sentence and a string for a name. The function should return True if the name exists within the string (ignoring any differences in capitalization).

2. Every Other Letter
For this next challenge, we are going to create a function that extracts every other letter from a string and returns the resulting string. There are a few different ways you can solve this problem. 

3. Reverse
This one is similar to the last challenge. Instead of selecting every other letter, we want to reverse the entire string. This can be performed in a similar manner, but we will need to modify the range we are using.

4. Make Spoonerism
A Spoonerism is an error in speech when the first syllables of two words are switched. For example, a Spoonerism is made when someone says “Belly Jeans” instead of “Jelly Beans”. We are going to make a function that is similar, but instead of using the first syllable, we are going to switch the first character of two words. 

5. Add Exclamation
Let’s say we are writing a program that displays a large message on a blimp and we need to fill in any missing space if a short phrase is provided. Our function will accept a string and if the size is less than 20, it will fill in the remaining space with exclamation marks until the size reaches 20. If the provided string already has a length greater than 20, then we will simply return the original string.
