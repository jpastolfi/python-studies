1. In Range

Let’s start the advanced challenge problems by testing if a number falls within a certain range. We will accept three parameters where the first parameter is the number we are testing, the second parameter is the lower bound and the third parameter is the upper bound of our range. 

2. Same Name
We need to write a program that checks different names and determines if they are equal. We need to accept two strings and compare them.

3. Always False
There are some situations that you normally want to avoid when programming using conditional statements. One example is a contradiction. This occurs when your condition will always be false no matter what value you pass into it. Let’s create an example of a function that contains a contradiction. 

4. Movie Review
We want to create a function that will help us rate movies. Our function will split the ratings into different ranges and tell the user how the movie was based on the movie’s rating.

5. Max Number
For the final challenge, we are going to select which number from three input values is the greatest using conditional statements. To do this, we need to check the different combinations of values to see which number is greater than the other two.
